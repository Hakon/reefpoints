This past August [GitHub released file editing using the Ace code
editor](https://github.com/blog/905-edit-like-an-ace) It's pretty damn
awesome if you haven't tried it. Basically, you get
[TextMate](http://macromates.com) in your
browser. Here are [DockYard](http://dockyard.com) we've been using
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to host this blog. The posts
are written in [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). So we're
doing all of our post creation and editing locally.

#### The Dream ####

It would be awesome if GitHub allowed us to create new [blobs](http://book.git-scm.com/1_the_git_object_model.html) from GitHub.
At that point GitHub would be a full-service blog engine. Think about it, they already do the
hosting, version tracking and editing of files through the web
interface. If file creation was added that's pretty much all I would
want. ([Jekyll has a way to track drafts by settin the `published`
flag](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter))

So if anybody at GitHub is reading, can we please have this feature?
