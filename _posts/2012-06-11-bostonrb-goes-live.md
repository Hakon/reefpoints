Starting tomorrow night (June 12th, 2012) [The Boston Ruby Group](http://bostonrb.org)
will be streaming its monthly meeting live via [Google Hangouts on Air](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/google-hangouts-on-air-broadcast-your.html)

This will allow those that cannot attend the meeting to watch the raw
stream live from anywhere in the world on [YouTube](http://youtube.com).
We will also reserve a few seats in the Google Hangout itself for other
user groups in the New England area to join. Questions will be allowed from
these user groups after each presentation just as any
audience member will be able to.

We're very excited about using this technology to expand
[BostonRB](http://bostonrb.org). If things go well we will want to
invite more user groups to virtuall attend our meetings in the future.
If you are an organizer of a small local group and have difficulty
pulling in some of the larger names in the Ruby community for
presentations we want you to leverage BostonRB.

In addition, even though Boston is a great tech-hub we still are far
enough away where it is difficult for some presenters to travel. We
would like to invite presenters to BostonRB to present their material
via Google Hangouts.

In the coming months we plan on using the Google Hangouts technology in
new ways to reach out to our community. Imagine having live office hours
where local expert Ruby devs can answer questions. Or online classes
where students can follow along. We understand that getting to some of our
events can be difficult or even intimidating. Now we can eliminate that
barrier.

So please follow the [BostonRB Twitter Account](http://twitter.com/BostonRB). Tomorrow night
we'll tweet the link to the live stream. We'll also embed the YouTube player
onto the BostonRB homepage. In the future we'll be making other very
cool announcements as well.

As always, if you are in Boston we [invite you come to the meeting](http://guestlistapp.com/events/107814)
and if you are not in Boston or cannot make it you now have a new
option.
