I first met Angelo when we both worked at [zendesk](http://zendesk.com) two years ago. I had heard about him before this as he had done some redesigns for [The Boston Ruby Group](http://bostonrb.org) website. Over the few months that zendesk was in Boston we got to be friends, and when we both left zendesk I knew this was someone I wanted to work with again in the future. That opportunity came when I moved back to Boston in the summer of 2010. For the past year Angelo and I have been collaborating on several projects and I'm happy to announce that he has agreed to come on as a partner for DockYard.

Angelo has been working in Rails for a few years now, and is a master of
all things CSS. His love for typefaces has influenced me quite a bit in
how I approach web design.
