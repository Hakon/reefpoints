![Spock Pitch](/images/spockpitch.png)

I like going to Boston Technology Social events for three reasons:

1. I live in Boston
2. I like talking about technology
3. I'm a social person and I enjoy meeting new people

Lately, there has been a growing trend. I can see it coming from a mile
away. The shoulders go back, the stance widens, the pupils dialate. **Oh
fuck, I'm about to get pitched to.** I come away feeling violated, I want
to take shower. But I know it's just going to happen again and again.

This is not a Boston problem, but I suspect it is a tech problem. I
cannot go to a tech event any more and expect to have actual
conversations with people. It's true that when you're making new
connections sometimes the conversation is just small talk, but it seems
the (self appointed) entrepreneures have decided that any opportunity to
practice their pitch is a good one.

I blame the incubators for this. Last year I went to [TechStars For A
Day](http://www.techstars.com/techstars-for-a-day/). It was terrible. Terrible enough to get me to pull my submission. (in retrospect it didn't have a chance) 
People lined up to speak to the mentors, pitch, move to the next person.
The experience was dehumanizing. But I can see how people come out of it
thinking they need to perfect their pitch. Mostly because that message
is drilled into your head. The only thing between you and millions of dollars is **the perfect pitch**.

I want to talk to people, not to a robot, not to a walking
advertisement. Nailing that pitch is not going to
