![Russ Jones](/images/russ-jones.png)

Russ and I met during the first [Rails Camp New
England](http://railscamps.com). Over the past few years we've gotten to know one another and have been looking to collaborate as developers. Last March Russ, myself, and a few others, got together to talk about the possibility of starting our own consultancy. Since getting a bunch of freelancers on the same schedule is difficult, it wasn't until 8 months later that I was finally able to bring Russ in on a project.

Russ has been developing in Rails since 2006, but has been focusing most of his recent development efforts on the client. When we joined up he immediately took ownership of a mobile web application, bringing some sanity to a combination of Phonegap, jQueryMobile and Backbone. He's already released a few open source projects for DockYard: [jquery-backbone](https://github.com/dockyard/jquerymobile-backbone) and [ember-jasmine-standalone](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-jasmine-standalone).

I'm very happy to announce that Russ has agreed to come on board as a
partner.

Now I just have to get him to write some blog posts...
